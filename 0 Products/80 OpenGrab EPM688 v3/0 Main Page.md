# OpenGrab EPM688 v3

<img src="image.jpg" class="thumbnail" title="Top view">

The EPM688 v3 is an electropermanent magnet, combining the advantages of electro and permanent magnets.
It has been developed by [NicaDrone](http://nicadrone.com) in collaboration with Zubax Robotics.

The magnetic domains in the AlNiCo magnets are aligned in a particular orientation as to form a magnetic circuit
with a ferrous target plate.
A short, 20us pulse current of 300A at 475V is generated by discharging the main PET capacitor through a
thyristor full bridge into the copper winding generating a field of 100kAm.
This is done 3 times to achieve full turn on.
Several pulses are used with decreasing amplitude and directing to demagnetize the EPM.
The key advantage is a very strong electromagnet that does not consume energy during steady state operation,
only during cycling.

The device supports UAVCAN, RC PWM and push button operation.
