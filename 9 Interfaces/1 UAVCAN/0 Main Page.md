# UAVCAN interface

<img src="uavcan_logo.png" class="thumbnail">

UAVCAN is a lightweight protocol designed for reliable communication in aerospace and robotic applications via CAN bus.
Zubax Robotics employs UAVCAN as a primary communication interface for many of its products.

The UAVCAN specification is available at [uavcan.org](http://uavcan.org).

## Connectors

     title="An example of a CAN bus termination plug. It has a 120-&Omega; resistor between the pins CAN H and CAN L">

Products by Zubax Robotics incorporate two UAVCAN Micro connectors in parallel for each available CAN interface.
Such parallel connection allows to eliminate an external T-connector when attaching the device to a CAN bus.
End nodes of the daisy chain must terminate the bus with 120&#8486; termination resistors,
typically in the form of termination plugs (pictured on the right).

The UAVCAN stack allows to use any redundantly interfaced node with a non-redundant bus by design.
In this case, **only the first interface must be used**, and the redundant interfaces should be simply left unconnected.

Non-redundant bus connection diagram:

Doubly redundant bus connection diagram:

<img src="can_bus_daisy_chaining_redundant.png" title="CAN bus daisy chaining - doubly redundant CAN bus">

Note that some nodes have embedded termination resistors, and therefore they do not require an
external termination plug on the unused connectors.
Such nodes are sometimes implemented with only one CAN connector, and therefore they
must be placed at the ends of the bus.

If the device incorporates redundant CAN interfaces,
the CAN bus connection circuitry prevents direct current flow between power inputs from different interface connectors,
so that if one bus suffers a power failure (e.g., a short circuit), it wonâ€™t affect the other bus.
The power inputs of all available interfaces are always protected by a self-recovering fuse or some other
overcurrent protection circuit.

## Cables

This part contains specifications for cables that are widely used with UAVCAN.
Items listed below can be [purchased from our distributors](http://zubax.com/sales-network).

should be used instead of the specified one.

Requirements to the twisted pair cable:

* Type: 4-core 2-pair twisted pair (see note below)
* Wire gauge: #26..30 AWG
* Wire strands: 7 or more
* Wire insulation diameter: 0.8 to 1 mm

It should be noted that most types of USB 2.0 cables would be a perfect fit to the requirements above.
Also there are some types of telephone cable that fit the requirements as well.

Certain applications that use very short CAN bus wiring (typically under two meters),
that are not subject to severe EMI, and/or that do not require high data rates,
may use flat cable instead of twisted pair.

##### Optional tools

Refer to the UAVCAN Micro Patch Cable assembly specification.

##### Manual assembly instructions

1. Bend one resistor lead at 180&deg; so that it points in the same direction with the other lead.
2. Cut both resistor leads at the same place so that the shortest one would be approximately 3 to 10 mm long.
3. Crimp two JST GH terminals directly on both resistor leads using hand crimp tool.
Relative rotation about the lateral axis between the crimped terminals should not exceed 45&deg;.
4. Do either:
    1. Slip an insulation tube (e.g. a heat shrink tube) on the longer lead.
Make sure the tube prevents the resistor leads from shorting with each other.
    2. Apply some liquid insulating varnish on the longer lead preventing it from shorting with the shorter lead.
    3. Ensure that the shorter resistor lead is less than 5 mm long,
so it can't be deformed enough to short with the longer lead. See the second step.
5. Insert the resistor leads with crimped terminals into a JST GH plug according to the specified pinout.
6. Slip a heat shrink tube on the resistor covering both leads and the resistor itself.
Make sure the tube has at least 3 mm long overhang on the outer side.
7. Apply heat to shrink the insulation.
8. Recommended: Using an ohmmeter ensure that the resistance between the pins 2 and 3 of the plug is within
120&plusmn;10 &Omega;.

## Node identification

All products by Zubax Robotics support the standard UAVCAN service `uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo`.
The response field `name` always contains a string that starts with `com.zubax.`,
immediately followed by the node name in lowercase with an underscore as a word separator.
For instance, a device named "Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic" may have the following name string:

```
com.zubax.subetha_sensomatic
```

Please refer to your product's documentation for its node name string value.

The following version information is always provided via `uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo` by all products:

* Hardware version number, major and minor
* 128-bit unique hardware ID
* Software version number, major and minor
* Software VCS commit hash
